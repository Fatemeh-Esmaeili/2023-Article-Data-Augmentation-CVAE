Scripts "s1d1SignalWiseDataAugmentNormal" and "s2d1SignalWiseDataAugmentAbnormal" contain CVAE designs for 35mer adenosine data augmentation networks and techniques; the former generates the normal data and the latter the abnormal data to mimic the real-world scenario.

Scripts "s3d2SignalWiseInterpolatedDataAugmentNormal" and "s4d2SignalWiseInterpolatedDataAugmentAbnormal" contain CVAE designs for 31mer and 35mer oestradiol data augmentation networks and techniques; the former generates the normal data and the latter the abnormal data to mimic the real-world scenario.

All functions are related to designing the required layers for CVAE or initialization functions.
